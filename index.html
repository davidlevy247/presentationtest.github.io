				The future of 5G is no longer limited to just smartphones.  The real benefit to enterprises will be industry use cases in many different sectors including health care, manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, retail and public sector.  

				These new use cases and technologies will require advanced capabilities that aren’t readily supported by 4G and Wi-Fi today.  As we work with Customer to deploy new technical solutions, a key question will be “what networking capabilities are required”.  Depending the network needs (capacity, speed, latency, reliability, etc.) T-Mobile for Business experts draw from a variety of Advanced Network Solutions to meet the Customer’s needs.

				This portfolio represents a comprehensive set of end-to-end solutions to address the massive increase in complexity with connectivity and network performance. Our 5G assets and unconventional mindset provide the best value for performance from both a cost and resource-requirement perspective, allowing you to start with a solution rightsized to your needs and scale up or down as required. We are turning the concept of private networks on its head – because while everyone needs improved performance these days, not everyone needs an expensive private network.

				First – we provide options and design a network that meets the needs of the customer.  If they need a private network based on their use case and a number of environmental factors, that’s what they’ll get.  However, we’re finding many don’t actually have those performance requirements, and can take a simpler approach.  This is turning the concept of “private networks” on it’s end, because we are only going to deploy what’s needed, which reduces the complexity.  
				We launched these solutions back in May, with OEM and system integrator partnerships that deliver a full package, with managed services and service level agreements.  
				We have an obsession (I believe Callie and Mishka will be using this term as well) to develop solutions that reduce the complexity so our customers can accelerate and be more successful in their transformations.

				Advanced Industry Solutions in Retail, Transportation, Manufacturing and Smart Cities.  
				Smart Cities (left), Transportation & Logistics, Retail, Manufacturing (right)

				Press release (do not distribute, it is not released yet and still a draft, but the messaging is solid):

				What’s the news: T-Mobile introduced a suite of ready-to-deploy solutions for municipalities and retail, manufacturing and logistics businesses with all the connectivity, compute, devices and applications needed to simplify smart solutions — putting them within reach of millions more. 
				Why it matters: 5G network solutions can deliver breakthrough results, but the complexity of most solutions leaves them out of reach for many businesses and municipalities. So, T-Mobile is lowering the barrier to entry with simple end-to-end smart solutions that are optimized for specific industries. 
				Who it’s for: Retail, manufacturing, and logistics businesses, and municipalities.
				BELLEVUE, Wash. — September 28, 2022 — Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) unveiled Advanced Industry Solutions, an end-to-end suite of connectivity, compute, devices, and applications needed to make smart cities, autonomous factories, and more, possible. Now businesses and municipalities don’t have to wade through endless options of technology vendors because the Un-carrier bringing it all together. 
 
				Right now, businesses of all sizes are looking to new technology to help them react quickly to changing customer demands, economic uncertainty, tight margins, strained supply chains and even the proliferation of devices outside the enterprise. So, it’s no surprise that manufacturing companies are dedicating 36% of their factory investments toward “smart” manufacturing, or that North America’s smart retail market is predicted to grow from $7.5 billion in 2020 to $20.8 billion in 2025. 
 
				That’s why T-Mobile is taking the company’s 5G Advanced Network Solutions to the next level with industry specific solutions for retail, manufacturing, logistics and smart cities. With these end-to-end packages, T-Mobile sources and manages all of connectivity, compute, devices and applications needed from the network core to a heat mapping sensor on the retail floor.  
 
				“We are on the precipice of billions of AI-powered devices, all connected by 5G with efficient application processors, all converging to provide intelligent data-driven insights. Technologies are pushing the limits of most companies’ IT organizations. That’s why, we’ve been working closely with many of these organizations to develop specific solutions that addresses their unique challenges,” said Callie Field, President T-Mobile Business Group. “Our Advanced Industry Solutions enable easier and simpler implementation … from vision to ROI … all backed by an ecosystem of world-class partners and the leading 5G network.”
 
				It's not easy designing a next-generation manufacturing plant or smart city. Business leaders need to consider the right connectivity, hardware, software and devices, which all come with their own unique web of infrastructure and vendors. Right now, to deploy a cutting-edge retail solution that does everything from parking space utilization to asset loss prevention, to temperature monitoring — businesses could have to work with 10 or more vendors and partners, which is immensely time-consuming considering that it takes an average of six months to onboard ONE vendor. And that’s before any revenue-producing work can happen. 
 
				About T-Mobile Advanced Industry Solutions
				Advanced Industry Solutions simplifies the process by managing all the pieces, so customers have only one team and company to work with. One company to be accountable, one company to provide support, one company to deliver results. At launch, the solution will include four major categories solutions for early adopter industries like logistics, manufacturing, retail and smart cities — with more to come! T-Mobile has done the heavy lift of pre-selecting, certifying and combining all the connectivity, compute, devices and applications into a single solution.   
				Here's some of the ways the solutions come to life across each of the four industries:
				Retail: Businesses can get the same kind of data about customers in-store as they do with customers online, including capturing things like foot traffic, dwell time and peak hours. It can also help customers gauge the effectiveness of marketing efforts like window merchandising and in-store kiosk displays. This is all made possible by industry-specific vendors like Retail Lite, a retail analytics solution from Fast Sensor.
				Manufacturing: Customers can automate clunky and outdated processes. Elements like heatmap activity tracking can help them optimize the layout of a plant. And technology from Taqtile AR—a graduate of T-Mobile’s 5G Open Innovation Lab—uses AR-compatible equipment to help improve employee training, decrease equipment downtime and increase overall product quality in manufacturing.
				Logistics: Companies can address lingering supply chain issues from the pandemic and other world events. The high bandwidth and low latency capabilities of 5G ANS can help improve bottlenecks through applications like connected vehicles, with fleet management and telematics, asset monitoring and tracking from companies like GeoTab. 
				Municipalities: The smart cities solution includes elements like smart monitoring for enhanced security, parking and traffic flow optimization for a better commute experience and stronger event/open space connectivity.
 
				With America’s largest and fastest 5G network, T-Mobile delivers an unbeatable set of connectivity options for businesses and government organizations:  
				T-Mobile’s 5G Advanced Network Solutions offer a variety of supercharged connectivity options for lower-latency and higher bandwidth – T-Mobile Public Network, a Hybrid Mobile Network and a Private Mobile Network — with the option to add compute to any of these. 
				T-Mobile Business Internet, a 5G fixed wireless solution, simplifies connectivity for businesses with multiple retail or office locations nationwide, delivering speed, flexibility, enhanced security and the cloud-delivered managed services for configuration, monitoring, and analytics. 
				T IoT, a comprehensive enterprise solution for global IoT connectivity, streamlines global IoT connectivity, platform management and support. 
 
				And the best part is that T-Mobile experts will be ready to advise at every step in the process — from design, deployment, trouble shooting and ongoing management of the network solutions. Now with pre-packaged Advanced Industry Solutions, T-Mobile is removing yet another barrier to entry to help businesses embrace technology solutions of the future.

				While a lot of those examples may feel futuristic, the reality is that many of our customers already have, or are planning on deployments just like those.  

				Yet many executives find themselves stalled in their efforts.  We’ve seen this as we’ve worked with them over two years, and so we analyze, got to the root causes, and are one by one, developing solutions that will address them.  
				So we can take 5G from a vision for so many businesses . . . to a reality.  
				These reports don’t’ only come from our customers but from a number of industry studies.  For example, in KPMG’s transforming the transformation report, they studied transformation performance for select companies from 2008 to 2020 
				Interestly enough – 26% were successful, and 26% failed.  
				Success is defined as improved profits and growth
				Failure is defined as no profit or growth
				In the middle are a variety of companies that improved profit but not growth, and vice versa.  
				And one of the key reasons for less than success?

				This Transportation & Logistics landscape slide is meant to be used in customer discovery and merely an example.  It depicts a common distribution/transportation workplace environment and highlights key use cases or business needs that align with our generally available TFB solutions.  A typical opening would be… “In working with other businesses like yours, we have seen the need for solutions like these…Do you have similar needs”?  The idea is to get the customer to start talking about their business needs.  The use cases/need references are generic.  

				The following product examples (not all encompassing) provides mapping between the generic needs and our specific TFB solutions.  A link is also provided to take you to additional Product Marketing resources out on BigTinCan.
